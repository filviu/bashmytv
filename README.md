Simple script to print episodes to watch & aquire using myepisodes.com as a backend.

You need an account at http://www.myepissodes.com, after you login go to http://www.myepisodes.com/rsshelp.php#unwatched to find your feed links. It's up to you if you use showignored=0 or showignored=1, it works either way

* You need curl installed
